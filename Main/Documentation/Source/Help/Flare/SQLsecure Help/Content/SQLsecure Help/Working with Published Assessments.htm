            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p class="Body">A published assessment represents the review phase of your audit process. Published assessments typically contain the required security checks and an accurate security status for your audited instances, as well as any explanation notes regarding known violations or discrepancies. </p>
                <p class="Body">When you publish an assessment, it is automatically set to the published mode. SQLsecure begins tracking each subsequent change applied to the assessment. Use the <a href="View Assessment Change Log.htm">Change Log</a> tab to review this activity.</p>
                <p class="Body">Use the published mode to create and maintain a historical electronic trail of change activity, ensuring you can validate and document when, how, and why changes were made.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p class="Body">Approving an assessment lets you safely archive your assessment for future reference. An approved assessment proves you are in compliance with specific corporate and government regulations, and have successfully completed an audit.</p>
                <p class="Body">For each subsequent audit, you can start (save)&#160;a new assessment using the approved assessment as a template. </p>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p class="Body">Approve an assessment when the internal or external audit team has "signed off"&#160;on your assessment and it is ready to be archived. Approved assessments accurately represent your security status at a specific point in time and no longer require changes.</p>

Approving an assessment lets you safely archive a final version of this assessment, preserving your findings and explanation notes.

                <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to compare the findings and settings of this assessment against another saved assessment or the original policy.

                <p class="DefinitionListTerm">Save as New Assessment</p>
                <p class="DefinitionListBody">Allows you to create a new assessment that uses the same settings and audit data as the selected assessment.
