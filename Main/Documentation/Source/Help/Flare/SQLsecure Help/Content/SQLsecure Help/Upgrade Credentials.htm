        <h1 class="Heading1">Upgrade Credentials</h1>
        <p class="Body">SQLsecure no longer uses the credentials of your SQL&#160;Server Agent to collect Operating System and SQL&#160;Server security information. This change improves the security model of SQLsecure. If, in a previous version of SQLsecure, it was specified that SQLsecure should use the credentials of the SQL Agent to collect security information, you will have to enter new credentials. </p>
        <p class="Body">The credentials you enter on the Upgrade Credentials window are applied to all registered SQL&#160;Server instances (where you had previously elected to use the default SQL&#160;Agent permissions to collect data). If you cannot use the same credentials for all your registered SQL&#160;Server instances,you will need to update the credentials used on the SQL&#160;Server Properties Window for each of your SQL&#160;Server instances. For more information, see <a href="ASP Credentials tab.htm">Credentials</a>.</p>
