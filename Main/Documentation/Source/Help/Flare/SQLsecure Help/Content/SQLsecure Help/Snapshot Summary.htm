            <MadCap:keyword term="snapshots:about;snapshots:results" />SQLsecure uses audit snapshots to capture SQL&#160;Server user and object permission settings. These snapshots are listed in Explore Permissions tree. A snapshot is a set of audit data that SQLsecure has collected from a specific SQL&#160;Server instance. You can configure snapshot filters to select which SQL&#160;Server objects you want to audit.&#160;You can take snapshots <a href="Take Snapshot.htm#_Toc188773010">manually</a>, as you need fresh data, or <a href="Schedule Snapshots.htm">schedule snapshots</a> to be taken at regular intervals.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Snapshot Summary tab provides detailed information about your snapshot, including the time it was taken, the collection statistics, audit filter information, and a listing of any Suspect Windows accounts or unavailable databases that were encountered while the Snapshot was being taken. For more information on unresolved Windows accounts, see <a href="Suspect Windows Accounts.htm">Identify Suspect Windows Accounts</a>. For more information on unavailable databases, see <a href="Unavailable Databases.htm">Identify Unavailable Databases</a>.</p>
