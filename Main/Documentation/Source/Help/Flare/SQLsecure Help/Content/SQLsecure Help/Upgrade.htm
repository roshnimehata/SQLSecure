            <MadCap:keyword term="upgrade;Release Notes:upgrade" />You can easily and quickly upgrade to the latest version of SQLsecure. Upgrading will not delete or alter any existing snapshots or policies. For more information about this release, see <a href="http://www.idera.com/Help/SQLsecure/2-7/RN" target="_blank">what’s new</a>.</p>
        <p class="StepIntro">To upgrade:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedList">Use an administrator account to log onto the computer on which you previously deployed SQLsecure.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Close all open applications.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Run <code>Setup.exe</code> in the root of the installation kit.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList">Follow the prompts, and then click <span class="GUI_Item">Finish </span>when done. The setup program automatically upgrades each SQLsecure component on the target computer.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you have previously deployed Reports</span>, use the <a href="Deploy Reports Wizard Welcome.htm">Deploy Reports wizard</a> to upgrade your deployment.</li>
            <li class="NumberedList"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If your existing policies include security checks that cite OS and SQL&#160;Server versions</span>, you must manually update the related security checks to include the latest releases, such as SQL&#160;Server 2012 RTM.</li>
        </ol>
