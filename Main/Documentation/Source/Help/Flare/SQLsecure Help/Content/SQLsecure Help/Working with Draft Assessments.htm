                <p class="Body">A draft assessment represents the first step, or stage, in the audit process. Draft assessments typically contain your initial findings, including any discrepancies that should be investigated before your review.</p>
                <p class="Body">When you save a new assessment, it is automatically set to draft mode. You can update and change draft assessments as often as you want. However, changes made in draft mode are not tracked.</p>
                <p class="Body">Use the draft mode to set up your assessment configuration settings to reflect the goals and requirements of your upcoming audit, identify discrepancies, and obtain internal feedback on your findings.</p>

                <p class="Body">Publishing a draft assessment allows you to begin tracking any changes made to the assessment settings and findings. This <a href="View Assessment Change Log.htm">Change Log</a> provides an electronic trail that lets you ensure your audit data and resultant assessment is correct and accurate, and validate any updates.</p>
