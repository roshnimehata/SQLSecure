In the approved mode, you can manually add or remove notes about an approved assessment by editing the <span class="GUI_Item">Notes </span>field on the <a href="Edit Assessments.htm">Assessment Properties</a> window.You can also continue to use the <a href="View Assessment Change Log.htm">Change Log</a> tab to review activity that previously occurred on this assessment.
