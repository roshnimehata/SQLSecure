        <p class="Body">The Take Snapshot window gives you the option to collect audit data at the end of the registration process. Choose this option when you want to immediately perform a security <MadCap:keyword term="snapshots:take at server registration" />assessment on the newly registered instance. Note that you can also manually take a snapshot later by selecting <span class="GUI_Item">Take Snapshot</span> on the Explore Permissions view.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="If_Then_Statement">If you are adding several SQL&#160;Server instances to SQLsecure</span>, you may not want to take a snapshot at the end of the Register SQL&#160;Server wizard process. Taking a snapshot from more than one instance at a time can degrade the Console performance.</p>
