        <p class="Body">The General tab of the Assessment Properties window allows you to update the name and description of the selected assessment as well as any notes you want to provide. </p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="GUI_Item">Notes </span>field allows you to enter notes, questions, and other information about this assessment. Use these notes as a “cheat sheet” to remember details about your environment or security assessment from one audit to another. This approach ensures you gather all the data you need.
