        <h1 class="Heading1">How does SQLsecure help me?</h1>
        <p class="Body">Because of the many different and complex ways to grant access to SQL Server databases – including server and database roles, Active Directory and local groups, inherited permissions,  explicit grants and denies, just to name a few – it is virtually impossible to manually analyze a security model across instances or determine a user’s rights on specific database objects. SQLsecure does this for you, answering the important question “Who can do what, where, and how on my SQL Servers?” SQL secure provides a comprehensive, automated solution for analyzing, monitoring, and reporting on security access rights in SQL Server databases.</p>
